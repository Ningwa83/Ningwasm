<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HELLO! I am Ningwahang(Limbu Sanam), born and grown up in Nepal and currently residing in Hong Kong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life becomes more valuable after we see our death closer. Death is truthiest of all. I encountered kind of situations which were undesired, unexpected, unwelcomed and extremely unpleasant. When our days are numbered, we try to give those some special moments. The time when i knew not of my number of days, i either ignored or postponed any future plans or anything that i had to do with my life and for the family thinking that i have a long way ahead to think about these. But now i have to rush for evey accomplishment with a fear of not being accomplished due to short of time. I did learned some programming languages in my school and college days which could never be used in my life and career as i did not complete any of those courses. Recently with the help of some online workshops, i am reviving those faded knowledges. And also this page promotes "ningwasm". Ningwasm is all about the ningwa's ideology of living, understanding the world and dealing necessarily with the negative and positive elements of society.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago, i kept an egg hoping one day it will hatch a cute innocent chick. But one day a fully grown chicken came out of egg and ran away flapping its wings. Mysterious but funnyðŸ˜‚. Then i realised all the successfuls are not necessarily hard working.      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Find some useful stuffs at the homepage below. More useful stuffs  are yet to come....</p>
